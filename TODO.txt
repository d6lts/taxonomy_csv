=====================

User interface
  X 622 display result of import
  X 622 display imported terms
  X 622 notice warnings and errors of import file
  X 622 choose level of message
  o     cumulate important messages with use Drupal's log
  X 622 auto create vocabulary
  X 630 test on an existing vocabulary (duplicating it)
  X 630 dynamic options and examples (existing items should match source type)
  X 630 import by a text area. See taxonomy_batch_operations
  o     text area to modify line when warning
  X 620 add link to use module after installation
  X 630 remind previous options values
  X 630 do a uninstall hook if remind previous options values is done
  X 622 warn remove when there is only one column and update is chosen
  -     reset button (useless)
  X 630 recommended default values button
  o     inform about changes during import (ex: relations set then unset)
  o     two steps import (validate and display warnings then process)
  o     option to choose one or two steps
  o     five step wizard for non-ahah users
  X 630 notice exceed file size
  o     option to import in original vocabulary after import in a duplicate
  o     no warning on last empty lines
  o     ahah ui for specific parameters
  o     disable utf8 option if textarea import
  x 640 add a csv enclosure option (so >= php 4.3)
  o     use Drupal themes

Functions
  o     import of structured alphabetic terms list (thesaurus)
  o     import of iso 2788 as in taxonomy_xml (but KISS by line approach)
  X 623 option to import sub-relations and not only relations to first term
  X 623 option to make relations to terms of all vocabularies.
  x 630 import of ancestors structure and not children (change name)
  o     import of first level parents
  o     import of first level children
  X 622 use of parents of previous line for children without ancestors
          ("one term by line structure import")
  o     parent merge (polyhierarchy)
  X 620 distinction between description and synonyms
  o     multiple files import
  -     sensitive or not to uppercase/lowercase (not in D6: see taxonomy.module)
  o     integrate or reference to Taxonomy manager module
  o     remove csv terms import choice
  o     test before import (autocreate a vocabulary) (see UI)
  o     remove ignore existing terms choice (see dynamic options above)
  -     import related in other vocabulary before current vocabulary (not in D6)
  o     auto detect good source content and vocabulary with a previous line key
  o     with auto detect, import mutliple type with one file
  o     convert and export vocabulary to xml (in particular to compare with xml)
  x 640 multistep import: autodivide big taxonomy to avoid server memory error
  o     import by term identifiant (tid)
  o     import from url

Code / security
  o     remove query and use only Drupal core ones and php filters (useful?)
  o     see if there is Drupal functions to import only synonyms or related etc.
  X 622 manage and inform on input error
  o     factorize code and use more php functions (callback for import type...)
  X 622 redo a cache
  X 622 clean the input line at the beginning of process and never after
  o     use taxonomy_parser?
  X 622 change the type of vocabulary (flat, monohierarchy, polyhierarchy)
  X 630 add hook_perm
  o     add hook_info
  X 630 replace _taxonomy_csv_parse_size by a Drupal function
  o     no order to import files
  o     use Drupal management of errors (mysql log)
  X 622 change function name to internal, except some
  o     vocabulary check (after and before)
  o     vocabulary relations integrety check and attribute
  -     time out control (useless with batchset mechanism)
  o     fix: keep multiple parents when children import
  X 622 fix: when ignore existing items, search in imported terms cache before
  o     fix: result statistic import (sometime, imported terms number is wrong)
  o     remove useless define
  o     use a global messages variable or sandbox to avoid multiple copy
  -     relations with other vocabularies (not officially supported in Drupal 6)
  o     extract all helps of forms to help.html in order to remove duplicates
  x 640 simplify batch set (all $options aren't needed)
  o     use $form_state['storage'] for batch operations?
  o     remove base64 temporary and work only with utf8
  -     use a smarter regexp delimiter than fgetcsv or explode
  o     fix: when a file is set, avoid UI bug when first option changes
  o 630 change Warning empty line by a simple notice
  o     modularize code to simplify addition of new schemes
  o     fix: make multistep import compatible with one term by line import
